On a daily basis we collect and analyze millions of data points to help to solve the problems of parking. We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our growing Business Analytics team and help us make it faster and easier for people to get where they need to go.

The Business Analytics team at FLASH owns the flow of... data from its raw state in our data warehouse to the BI tools and data products that consume it. This means our analysts are regularly building/updating ETLs and data models via SQL, surfacing data in our BI tools via dashboards and interactive data products, and working with stakeholders across multiple departments to formulate goals and build a deeper understanding of our two-sided marketplace. Your day-to-day work will be SQL and BI-tool heavy, but will also require you to operationalize ambiguous business problems into answerable questions, translate the data you pull into effective visualizations, and clearly communicate key findings.

This role in particular will be primarily focused on sales and operations, which means working on things like building and scheduling automated reports in Looker, designing impactful internal-facing dashboards to drive insight and efficiency, onboarding recently acquired data sources through knowledge-building and SQL-based data modeling, supporting the development of a new customer-facing reporting portal, and more. We're in an exciting and rapidly evolving industry that requires constant innovation, evaluation, and iteration. Help us perfect the parking experience and make an impact on the industry!

• Experience with some flavor of data visualization and dashboard building in a BI tool (we use Looker and Tableau)
• The business sense to understand why you're pulling data and whether it seems accurate...not just pulling it
• You like to formulate the right questions versus just seeking answers to make sure the best and smartest decisions get made

What you get
• The tools - or additional tools, if need be - to get the job done
• A data engineering team to help you get clean, reliable data and maintain the ETLs you build

13,"Sr. Data Analyst, Business Operations",Homeward,"Austin, TX",via Getwork,"About Homeward

Buying a home should be an exciting milestone. But all too often, it's stressful, especially in a competitive market or when you're buying and selling at the same time. So we're redesigning the homebuying experience. We're a fast-paced real estate startup that empowers agents to help homebuyers buy with cash. We buy homes on behalf of our partners' clients with our cash, then the... client buys the home back from us.

Founder and CEO Tim Heyl, a 10-year industry veteran and owner of one of the fastest-growing agent teams in the country, started Homeward in 2018. In fact, he bought our first customer's home with his own life savings. Today we offer two services — Buy with cash and Buy before you sell.

We've raised more than $160MM in equity capital from top-tier venture investors, including Norwest, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Adams Street, Javelin, and LiveOak. Our leadership team includes experts from the real estate, mortgage, and technology industries.

About the opportunity

Homeward's massive growth over the last twelve months and continued plan for more growth, the need and desire for meaningful, clean, concise data is also growing. The ideal candidate will contribute to tackling that ever growing need. You have strong analytical, technical, and visualization skills. This role will work on providing level two and three insights by creating and publishing reports and ensuring accuracy is maintained throughout Homeward's product changes and evolution. This is an opportunity to help support and strengthen the already existing analytical skills outside of the core team and create 'Power Users' to enable self-serve insights.

This position is not eligible for Visa sponsorship.

In this role you will:
• Report to our Head of Business Analytics and partner with stakeholders to develop a business analytics roadmap for improving the company wide availability, speed and quality of data/analysis that accelerates decision making
• Provide innovative analytical insight, supporting various functions across Homeward
• Assist with the development and ongoing refinement of Homeward's canonical data model in partnership with the data engineering and product teams
• Deliver a broad range of outputs; dashboards, deep-dive analysis, NPS reporting, segmentation work, etc
• Be data subject matter expert for company's OKR roadmaps & guiding teams to metrics, data points, and outcomes
• Launch a training program to introduce new team members to data at Homeward with the goal of empowering and upskilling members of all internal teams to serve up their own data and insights
• Support development, maintenance and organization of performance reporting and management dashboards for all of Homeward's functional areas of operations and optimizations

What you'll bring:
• 5+ years of proven experience in business analytics, business intelligence or comparable role; preference for experience within high-growth startups and/or top-tier mgmt consulting
• Experience creating, maintaining, supporting metrics within a BI tool (Mode, Looker, Tableau preferred)
• Expert proficiency in SQL (Standard SQL, BigQuery, PostgreSQL); bonus points for experience with Python
• Demonstrated ability to synthesize independently generated data points into a cohesive analysis, and clearly communicate the results of complex analyses to a wide audience in a credible fashion
• Strong organizational, planning, quantitative and analytical skills; strategic and creative thinking with keen business judgment, focus, and ability to see the ""big picture""
• Excellent interpersonal skills and have experience working directly with senior leadership
• Excellent communication and relationship-building skills
• Tangible experience building something from the ground up

Our Values

THE GOLDEN RULE

Whether we're dealing with colleagues or customers, we follow The Golden Rule, treating others the way we want to be treated. It's a simple rule, but it's also significant: we don't prioritize money or growth over people, and we practice empathy at every opportunity.

CALM FOCUS

We work in tech and build solutions for real estate. Both are fast-paced and stressful industries. So it's important that we focus on the larger objective rather than rushing from one task to the next. If something is out of scope, we say ""No."" If something feels rushed, we pump the brakes. This calm focus helps us create solutions our customers love.

ONE TEAM, ONE DREAM

Big problems require big solutions. We look at our customers' experience holistically, and recognize that solving them requires collaboration across teams. This approach extends to cooperation among our three affiliate companies — Homeward, Homeward Mortgage and Homeward Title — and produces a more integrated homebuying experience",,"['24 min', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']","{'schedule_type': 'Full-time', 'commute_time': '24 min'}",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,78738,none,none,-1,-1,none,none,none,4.2,32,none,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Homeward-Reviews-E2532761.htm?utm_campaign=google_jobs_reviews&utm_source=google_jobs_reviews&utm_medium=organic,https://boards.greenhouse.io/homeward/jobs/5911158002?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,Apply on Greenhouse,none,Glassdoor,https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e54498bcb076d7ffdd32285/60fafa504003761fea9a32e1_Homeward%20Logo_Dark.png,"<iframe

71,Content Strategist III,myGwork,"Bee Cave, TX",via Adzuna,"Content Strategist III

Are you a versatile content strategy leader who gets excited about solving challenging customer service problems at an enterprise-scale? Do you want to use your skills to help agents get quick, useful answers to their questions? Do you thrive when handling ambiguity and change? Then let's talk about this opportunity to join the Conversation Platform and Customer Experience... Operations Content Strategy Team at Expedia Group!

We would love to see an example of your expertise, style, and creativity.

Please provide a link to your portfolio or attach samples, as applications without portfolios will not be considered.

We're redefining our traveler and agent experiences with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning in mind. We put the traveler first and use data to drive our decisions. As part of our team, you'll partner across disciplines (UX and LX Designers, Product Managers, Engineering, and others) to co-create simple, intuitive, useful, and cohesive knowledge product experiences and narratives that are context-aware, human, and delightful. You'll define the content (for the knowledge base, email, and more) that helps users get the right help information at the right time. You'll solve for the presentation of knowledge and learning product content in the experience, as well as the structure that delivers that content.

Who you are:
• You're a blend of people leader, storyteller, UX writer, and content designer
• You know how to identify user needs and find the right content to meet those needs
• You use logic, data, research, and empathy for your user to inform your choices and can back up your recommendations with solid reasoning
• You love competitive analysis and are enthusiastic about creating cohesive content strategies
• You live and breathe everything content strategy and love technology
• You're immersed in UX and LX process: you aren't looking for editorial content creation, social media strategy, or content marketing role
• You're nimble: you pivot quickly when priorities shift, or requirements change
• You're a strong communicator and understand the role content plays in design and performance
• You advocate for solutions that balance the needs of agents and travelers with business objectives
• You have an eye for details and know the difference between good and bad content
• You're biased to action, able to prioritize and consistently meet deadlines
• You're an excellent project manager: you stay on top of your deliverables and get things done

What you will do:
• Audit, analyze, structure, create, and present content independently using established frameworks, and coach a small team to do the same
• Consistently communicate strategy and team direction to team and stakeholders
• Actively encourage team members to seek diverse feedback on agent experience work
• Help team members prioritize and link daily work to broader objectives and manage workloads to ensure all team members are fully deployed and skills are matched to the work requirements
• Bring a content strategy view to define and refine the Knowledge Graph which is the brains behind the ML
• Focus increasingly on content problems across systems and product areas
• Work reciprocally with fellow content strategists as well as designers, engineers, product managers, and many others to conceptualize content-focused experiences and bring your work to life
• Assess competitor content and user experiences for content coverage, quality, gaps, and emerging industry and content trends
• Identify content needs and gaps across multiple stages of the user journey, and create content to address those gaps
• Communicate your findings, recommendations, and content specifications through user scenarios, presentations, comps, prototypes, and style guides
• Describe and present your methods, explorations, and rationale along with a recommendation to varied audiences
• Lean on industry standards and trusted methodologies but still experiment

We know there's no single path to becoming a content strategist. So, we look for:
• A portfolio or link with the representation of your work, attached to your application
• More than 5 years of professional experience with content strategy for large enterprise websites or applications, both internal and consumer-facing interfaces
• Understanding of the development, sourcing, and governance of both structured and unstructured content types
• Knowledge of mobile-first and responsive content strategies
• Experience writing and revising content for the user interface
• Experience working in Content Management Systems
• Experience with localization and writing for a global audience
• Experience with the UX lexicon and working in the UX design process
• Bachelor's degree in relevant field — English, Communications, Linguistics, HCI, Design
• Customer service and SEO experience are a plus.

This position involves booking (and unbooking) travel, scheduling (and rescheduling) meetings, keeping track of time and expenses, supporting the case team process, and generally keeping up with the fast pace of our Consulting Team...

While the consultants spend most of their time at the client site, back here at home base (aka the Austin, TX office) you will be surrounded by an Administrative Team that consists of a group of really smart, team-oriented people.

We won't define a career path for you – some of the Sr AAs we've hired in this role have gone on to have long and successful careers as Executive Assistants at BCG; others have gone into work in one of our many Practice Areas; some have managed teams or rotated through a number of other functions.

87,Executive Assistant,Sana benefits,"Austin, TX, United States",via Vabiso,"Our health system is broken, and it’s a huge problem. Costs are rising out of control while the patient experience gets worse. At Sana, we're passionate about fixing this problem by bringing accessible and affordable health plans to small and medium businesses. We've built an innovative team with top talent from across the health insurance and tech industries to create engaging, modern plans for... our clients. This allows our customers to offer competitive benefits packages while paying an average of 20% less than traditional plans.

Sana is seeking a motivated, highly organized, trustworthy, and experienced executive assistant to work and grow alongside Sana’s CEO and our high performance executive team. Our company has grown from 30 people to 80 people in the last year; fast growth brings with it a lot of competing priorities. Your job is to free up more of the CEO’s time and provide the executive team leverage so we can be more impactful as an organization.

In this role, your time will be split:

40% supporting CEO with business admin tasks

40% directly supporting the executive team and business at large

20% helping manage tasks in the CEO’s personal life

What you will do

Keep the CEO focused on the most important initiatives for the business - setting weekly priorities together, proactively managing calendar and communications to make sure the most important tasks get accomplished

Triage CEO’s correspondence, primarily over email and slack, building an understanding of what messages should be prioritized (news, investor outreach, services, etc) so you can be an effective filter and eventually handle a substantial amount of the correspondence yourself

Proactively manage the CEO’s time - booking meetings and appointments, planning travel, and taking other administrative tasks off his plate

Own executive team functions such as coordinating our weekly All Hands meetings, setting agendas and note-taking with our weekly department head meetings, collecting and disseminating status updates on company goals (OKRs), etc.

Manage occasional HR and office tasks like collecting laptops from departing employees, coordinating logistics around team gatherings and finding vendors to provide one-off services for our office

Assist with miscellaneous personal tasks, including finding residential contractors, coordinating with nannies/daycare, researching gifts, setting doctor & vet appointments, etc. The CEO has a newborn daughter, a dog, and a house - responsibilities he shares with his wife who is also a busy startup executive. Taking some of these tasks off of his plate can be a big time saver.

About you

3+ years of experience as an EA or in a similar administrative function

Austin resident preferred, but full remote is possible for the right candidateExcellent communication skills - verbal and written

Extremely organized and 100% reliableExcited about entrepreneurship and business in general. It’s ok if you don’t want to be an EA forever.

Fast learner. You adapt to new situations, processes, domains of knowledge quickly.

High level computer proficiency, including familiarity with tools like Google Apps, Slack, and Zoom

Comfortable working from home - we have an office in South Austin, but half of our company is remote; the CEO works from home often and you will have the option to work remotely most of the time if you prefer

You can maintain confidentiality and use a high degree of discretion. You'll have visibility into a lot of business & personal life details.

Pass a background check (ie no criminal history)

We use a more efficient financing structure and integrated technology solutions to cut out wasteful spending and get members access to better quality care at lower cost.

98,Executive Assistant,Bramlett Residential,"Austin, TX, USA",via Salary.com,"About the job

Are you an individual that likes to make plans, create lists, coordinate and ensure that things get done the right way quickly? Are you looking to start a career and work for a real estate company with an amazing team of colleagues...

We need to hire a highly organized, detail-oriented Executive Assistant to support our CEO. The ideal candidate should thrive working in a fast paced, startup environment and be excited about FUB's mission and potential. The ideal candidate will have outstanding time management skills, professional communication skills (verbal, written), attention to detail, and a strong sense of security and discretion. The person joining us must be comfortable with a team-first approach in a remote work environment.

• Assist with social events (childcare, reservations, etc)
• Set up IRL and Zoom meetings
• Update the office calendar

Our ideal candidate is a highly creative individual with conversation design/VUI experience who is excited to build effective and engaging client experiences through multimodal conversational interfaces. This is an exciting opportunity to participate on the ground floor of a new and growing team at Schwab.

Preferred skills: leadership of UX cross-functional teams, knowledge of accessibility, working in an Agile environment, and comfort with content workflow processes and delivery tools Information for recruiters. We put together these guidelines to help you recruit the best candidates for a content strategy role at Schwab. 1. The candidate should have at least 3 years of experience with the title Content Strategist, Product Content Strategist, Content Designer, Conversation Designer, UX Writer or similar. While roles as a marketer, social media strategist, writer, or editor may seem relevant, we're looking for someone who has additional skills. At Schwab, we look at things through our clients' eyes. Our Content Strategists promote a highly collaborative and inherently iterative approach so we design the right thing, design things right, and design something that works (i.e., something that can be developed and deployed in multiple environments, including mobile). To succeed at Schwab, Content Strategist candidates must have significant experience with user-centered design. They should know how to gather and integrate data and user feedback throughout the discovery, design, and post-launch cycles. 2. We want someone who can create multistep, interactive experiences. We typically design task-oriented experiences, such as buying or selling securities, transferring money, opening a new account, checking a routing number, or filling out forms. Throughout these experiences, users are entering information, selecting options, and making decisions. We want to see examples of this type of work in a Content Strategist's portfolio. Frequently, we see candidate portfolios focused on public site pages or advertising. These examples may demonstrate a candidate's writing skills, but they have limited value during our evaluation. 3. Financial services experience is a plus. It's not a requirement. Working at a big financial institution like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, E*Trade, or Fidelity is a good sign that a candidate will understand our business. With that said, we understand the value of new perspectives and welcome candidates with little or no financial services experience",https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQeSFsK7OVkcoavBhVFpcJ0F_e6PUuil-3LLhmehkg&s,"['4 days ago', 'Full-time']","{'posted_at': '4 days ago', 'schedule_type': 'Full-time'}",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,78751,,,-1,-1,none,none,none,3.6,2155,none,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Experis-Reviews-E608019.htm?utm_campaign=google_jobs_reviews&utm_source=google_jobs_reviews&utm_medium=organic,https://jobs.thejobnetwork.com/Job/527185622?SourceID=2&utm_campaign=google_jobs&utm_source=google_jobs&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,Apply on Jobs - TheJobNetwork,none,Glassdoor,https://www.austintechnologycouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Experis-Logo.jpeg,"<iframe

171,Executive Assistant,Vital Farms,"Austin, TX",via Lever,"Don’t wait. Anticipate. That’s the hallmark of a good executive assistant. But that’s not good enough for you. Because when you’re on the job, you’re a scheduling samurai, a disorganization destroyer, a problem-solver who proactively seeks out Murphy’s law and combats it with impeccable organization and risk mitigation strategies. You not only anticipate; you collaborate, accommodate, coordinate... communicate, and calculate what needs to get done on a daily basis with a rare combination of warmth, confidence, and efficiency that makes you the central nervous system of the executive suite. 

At Vital Farms, we’re looking for an Executive Assistant to the Senior Leadership Team who are not only passionate about their work and who strive for perfection, but who also see how their day-to-day efforts have the ability to create an impact on a much larger scale.

That’s because at Vital Farms, we’re on a mission to change the food industry one ethically sourced ingredient at a time. While we’re known for our pasture raised eggs - giving our hens 108 square feet to roam and calling bullsh*t on terms like cage free and free range - the truth is we’ve got big plans to do so much more. That’s because we give a cluck when it comes to the health of our animals, the health of our customers, and the health of our planet.

If that sounds like something you care about, too, let’s talk about how you can be a force multiplier for goodness at Vital Farms as the Executive Assistant.

As someone with your level of experience, you understand that trust is at the heart of everything you do. Your exemplary time management skills, your attention to detail, and your ability to anticipate different scenarios is what ultimately builds trust with senior executives. You know that plans can (and often do) change at the last minute, which is why you always have a backup plan. And a backup plan for that backup plan. Calm, cool, and collected, you crave predictability (for yourself and for those around you) and you always have an eye for optimization.

Who We Are:
Vital Farms is a Certified B Corp that sources and markets delicious, high-quality, ethically-sourced egg and dairy products nationwide. We started on a single family-farm in Austin, TX in 2007, with 20 Rhode Island hens and a drive to raise the standards in sustainable agriculture. Today, Vital Farms is THE leading producer of pasture raised eggs, partnering with more than 275 family farms, and selling into over 18,000 grocery stores around the country. We believe that a healthy bottom line is the result of healthy business practices, and we care deeply about supporting all our stakeholders. This includes our crew, our consumers, our retailers, and of course our happy hens and contented cows. In short, we exist to improve the lives of people, animals, and our planet through food.

Next Steps:
Shortly after you complete your application, you'll receive a follow-up email elaborating on any potential next steps in our process. If you don't immediately receive said follow-up email, we would highly encourage you to check your spam filter!

In order to fulfill Vital Farms mission to “bring ethically produced food to the table,” we seek to build teams that leverage diverse perspectives to create a welcoming and innovative environment that is committed to the principles of equal employment opportunities.

To that end, we make employment decisions based on qualifications, merit, and business need. Vital Farms does not discriminate on the basis of age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status, disability or any other status protected by law",https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQxY-uv5PdSFvrlc88icQSzFrDEScCFnrPpfcviWdk&s,"['18 min', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']","{'schedule_type': 'Full-time', 'commute_time': '18 min'}",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,78739,,,-1,-1,none,none,none,4.3,76,none,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Vital-Farms-Reviews-E831854.htm?utm_campaign=google_jobs_reviews&utm_source=google_jobs_reviews&utm_medium=organic,https://jobs.lever.co/vitalfarms/c3d63d61-1a3c-490f-8ae7-8625450754e8?utm_source=linkup&utm_medium=referrer&utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,Apply on Lever,none,Glassdoor,https://cdn.vitalfarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vitalfarmsgroupb.jpg,"<iframe
